# The Story of An Unconventional Software Engineer

Dear Hiring Manager,\
\
You might look at my resume and think: this is not a conventional software engineering path. You’re right, my path is unconventional, and that’s a strength.\
\
After my master’s, in the middle of the pandemic, I joined Apple as a contractor on an internal developer framework. I learned the stack from zero, delivered significant components quickly, and earned strong trust from my manager. That experience confirmed what I do best: ramp fast, own hard problems, and ship.\
\
Soon after, a China-based startup, Gaoxie Intelligent Technology, invited me to join as a founding engineer to build its application from 0 to 1. I left my current stable project for the chance to move faster in a flatter culture (also because I’m curious). Over two years, I grew from an implementation role to co-tech lead, guiding a 5-engineer team to ship to customers and help the company win early market share. That phase taught me extreme ownership, pragmatic decision-making, and how to align speed with product quality.\
\
I then set my sights back on the U.S. market, even amid a hiring freeze, because I wanted to apply what I’d learned to products with broader reach. I turned down strong offers in China and held to what I call my “foolish optimism”. It paid off. I joined Google as a contractor, learned Android from scratch, and was trusted to contribute to a high-stakes release: Pixel 9 Satellite SOS. It was a rare fast-paced, cross-functional environment inside big tech: more than 10 internal and external functional teams. I delivered my features, led a 14-person test effort, partnered smoothly across teams, so that the feature was released as a big success.\
\
Those experiences made one thing clear: I thrive in cultures that move quickly, value autonomy, and encourage deep collaboration. Along with my journey, I realize when those conditions don’t naturally exist, great engineers can still create them through effective upward management. Meanwhile, I see with my eyes that AI is blurring the line between Engineering and Product, future engineers must have strong customer and commercial mindsets, not just architectural ones. I took quick action to strengthen these muscles by pursuing MBA coursework focused on management, decision science, customer analytics and product strategy.\
\
I’m excited to bring this combination: hands-on engineering depth, startup-grade ownership, big-tech coordination, and product-savvy execution to the team. I pick up new stacks quickly, partner smoothly across functions, and turn ambiguity into shipped outcomes users notice and the business measures. Most of all, I care about culture: a bias for action, initiative, and enthusiasm, in service of both the customer and the company.\
\
I’d welcome a conversation about how I can contribute and help you ship faster with confidence.
